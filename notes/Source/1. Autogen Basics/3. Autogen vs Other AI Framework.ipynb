    "## 2. AutoGen v0.4 Overview <a id='autogen-overview'></a>\n",
    "AutoGen v0.4 is built on the following key principles:\n",
    "- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Agents operate asynchronously, responding to events dynamically.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Supports autonomous agent teams for complex tasks.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Efficiently handles large-scale agent networks.\n",
    "- **Observability**: Provides detailed insights into agent reasoning and interactions.\n",

    "## 3. AutoGen vs. LangChain <a id='autogen-langchain'></a>\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Architecture**: AutoGen uses an **event-driven, async architecture**, while LangChain relies on a **chain-based, sequential execution model**.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Capabilities**: AutoGen excels in **autonomous multi-agent collaboration**, whereas LangChain focuses on **single-agent workflows with structured steps**.\n",
    "- **Observability**: AutoGen provides **superior event tracking** for agent reasoning, while LangChain offers **basic tracing**.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: AutoGen’s async foundation supports **complex agent networks**, while LangChain’s synchronous design struggles with **large-scale systems**.\n",
    "- **Use Case Suitability**: AutoGen is ideal for **collaborative AI** (e.g., research teams), while LangChain is better for **data processing** or **question-answering**.\n",

    "## 4. AutoGen vs. CrewAI <a id='autogen-crewai'></a>\n",
    "### Key Differences\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: AutoGen offers both **low-level Core API** and **high-level AgentChat API**, while CrewAI provides a **prescriptive, template-based model**.\n",
    "- **Customization**: AutoGen allows **deep customization** of agent behavior, whereas CrewAI is better for **quick setups** with limited flexibility.\n",
    "- **Maturity**: AutoGen has a **longer history** and **larger community**, while CrewAI is newer with a **growing user base**.\n",
    "- **Learning Curve**: CrewAI is **simpler** for basic multi-agent tasks, while AutoGen requires **more learning** for advanced scenarios.\n",
    "- **Use Case Suitability**: CrewAI suits **straightforward team tasks** (e.g., content creation), while AutoGen handles **intricate, dynamic AI models** (e.g., enterprise workflows).\n",
