      "*   $a$ is a constant determining the scale of the curve.\n",
      "*   $t$ is a parameter. We must avoid values where $\\sin(t)=0$ (i.e., $t = n\\pi$ for integer $n$), as these correspond to vertical asymptotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this example, we will use $a = 5$.\n",
      "The parameter $t$ will be generated in two segments:\n",
      "1.  From a small positive value near $0$ to just before $\\pi$ (e.g., $0.01$ to $\\pi - 0.01$).\n",
      "2.  From just after $\\pi$ to just before $2\\pi$ (e.g., $\\pi + 0.01$ to $2\\pi - 0.01$).\n",
